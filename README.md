Dragon Vanquisher RPG
==========

This role-playing game (RPG) puts the player in the position of a dragon vanquisher, a character who must save a village from invading monsters. 
This game is entirely an original, and challenges the player to defeat monsters based on available resources. 
So far, _Chapter 1_ of the game has been complete. The story is still in development, and I intend on working on more customizations in the near future.

# Crafting your own story
You can make this game your own if you want to! Adding monsters is a simple task: all you have to do is add monster attributes in the `env` array of `script.js`. 
After that, create/upload an image of your monster. I've commented logical portions of the code to make it as readable as possible, and the names I've assigned to
variables or assets are also easy to understand. So, feel free to play around with everything implemented so far!
